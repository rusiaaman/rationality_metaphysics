# Introduction
I am writing down my notes as I go down the path of understanding physical and metaphysical reality through the means of rationality, methamatics, and scientific methods. 

## Motivation
A rational persona (agent) invevitably asks the "why" question repeatedly till they arrive to the big questions listed down, the answers to which are yet unknown though thought about since centuries. These are the same questions which motivates me to this journey.
1. Why something rather than nothing?
  In my opininon this is the biggest of them all. Why does anything have to exist at all? 
2. Why are we here? What is my (our) purpose?
  This is a more anthropic view of the first question. Do I have a purpose to fulfill? What is the meaning of life? 
3. If the Big-Bang theory is true, why did it happen? Does the question of "why" itself make sense here?

For other such big questions in philosophy this seems to be a good reference: [The big questions. Solomon et al.](http://elibrary.bsu.az/books_400/N_17.pdf)

# 1. (Rationality)[https://github.com/rusiaaman/rationality_metaphysics/master/rationality.md]
(Click here)[https://github.com/rusiaaman/rationality_metaphysics/master/rationality.md]
This section should answer the following:
1. How do we get to the truth?
2. How do we distinguish reality from fiction?
3. What should we believe when there is incomplete information?


# 2. (Science)[https://github.com/rusiaaman/rationality_metaphysics/master/science.md]
(Click here)[https://github.com/rusiaaman/rationality_metaphysics/master/science.md]
This section should answer the following:
1. What are the laws of nature? Bigbang, black holes, entropy, fate of the universe, space-time, constituents of matter and energy, etc.
2. What are the common patterns in human psychology? What biases are we riddled with? Why do we think what we think? Why are some people more rational than the others?  
3. How do we create artifical intelligence? Will it be conscious? What does it mean to be conscious?

# 3. (Metaphsics)[https://github.com/rusiaaman/rationality_metaphysics/master/metaphysics.md]
(Click here)[https://github.com/rusiaaman/rationality_metaphysics/master/metaphysics.md]
This section should answer the following:
1. If physical laws describe nature of reality, what describe the nature of physical laws themselves? Why is the value of c (speed of light) and h (plank's constant) what they are and not different? 
2. Are there other such realities? How does it affect us? Is multi-verse theory true, and if so how does it affect us?
3. Do we live in simulation? If so what's the nature of the world in which we are simulated? How does it affect us?
4.
