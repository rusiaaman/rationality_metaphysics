# Rationality
An agent such as a human like me would like to know the truth about everything. Rationality (as I hope to see) is the way to go about it. Before we dive into rationality, what it is and what it means, a question I would like to ask and answer is what we mean by "truth"?

Another good meta question that arises here is what is meant by the word 'meaning' itself when I ask about the meaning of "truth" or the meaning of life? Based on the wikipedia articles on ["meaning"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meaning), I feel it is not worth diving into the philosophy of the word "meaning", instead it is better to avoid the word and repostulate the fundamental question. I hope I will come back to this decision later on and see if it is a "rational" decision. 

*Instead of asking* **"What is the meant by truth?"** we ask: **"What should I belive as the truth?"** To me beliving is a very appropriate word choice here for asking the same question. In my thoughts and mental calculations, something is either the truth or not. The question is then simply what should we assign the truth and what not?
