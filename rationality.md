# Rationality
An agent such as a human like me would like to know the truth about everything. Rationality (as I hope to see) is the way to go about it. Before we dive into rationality, what it is and what it means, a question I would like to ask and answer is what we mean by "truth"?

Another good meta question that arises here is what is meant by the word 'meaning' itself when I ask about the meaning of "truth" or the meaning of life? Based on the wikipedia articles on ["meaning"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meaning), I feel it is not worth diving into the philosophy of the word "meaning", instead it is better to avoid the word and repostulate the fundamental question. That is:

*Instead of asking* **"What is the meant by truth?"** we ask: **"What should I belive as the truth?"** To me beliving is a very appropriate word choice here for asking the same question. In my thoughts and mental calculations, something is either the truth or not. The question is then simply what should we assign the truth and what not?

Notes:
1. A belief is what an agent like you and me has about the world. An agent creates their own model of the world. 
2. Reality is what we actually experience (sensory observations). For example, you feel cold when you touch snow. 
3. A belief is what determines our predictions our experiences. For example, if I touch snow I will feel cold.
4. A true belief would lead to predictions which conform to reality, i.e. you'd feel cold everytime you touch snow.
5. A true belief need not be able to predict observations. For example, the belief 'a photo continues travelling after reaching event horizon of a black hole' can't be tested since the photon would be forever lost for us, with no possibility of interaction.

Questions to ask:
1. How do we know a belief is true if it doesn't make any sensory predictions? Say, god exists but you can only meet him after death.
2. How to get to a true belief? What if snow suddenly stops feeling cold, does it mean the belief "snow is cold" was false all along?
