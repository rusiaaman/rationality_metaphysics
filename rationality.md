# Rationality
An agent such as a human like me would like to know the truth about everything. Rationality (as I hope to see) is the way to go about it. Before we dive into rationality, what it is and what it means, a question I would like to ask and answer is what we mean by "truth"?

Another good meta question that arises here is what is meant by the word 'meaning' itself when I ask about the meaning of "truth" or the meaning of life? Based on the wikipedia articles on ["meaning"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meaning), I feel it is not worth diving into the philosophy of the word "meaning", instead it is better to avoid the word and repostulate the fundamental question. That is:

*Instead of asking* **"What is the meant by truth?"** we ask: **"What should I belive as the truth?"** To me beliving is a very appropriate word choice here for asking the same question. In my thoughts and mental calculations, something is either the truth or not. The question is then simply what should we assign the truth and what not?

Notes:
1. A belief is what an agent like you and me has about the world. An agent creates their own model of the world. 
2. Reality is what we actually experience (sensory observations). For example, you feel cold when you touch snow. 
3. A belief is what determines our predictions our experiences. For example, if I touch snow I will feel cold.
4. A true belief would lead to predictions which conform to reality, i.e. you'd feel cold everytime you touch snow.
5. A true belief need not be able to predict observations. For example, the belief 'a photo continues travelling after reaching event horizon of a black hole' can't be tested since the photon would be forever lost for us, with no possibility of interaction.
6. Conclusion: correspondence between belief and reality is called "truth".

Questions to ask:
1. How do we know a belief is true if it doesn't make any sensory predictions? Say, god exists but you can only meet him after death. 
2. How to get to a true belief? What if snow suddenly stops feeling cold, does it mean the belief "snow is cold" was false all along? Answer: See section 2.
3. Do we still need to observe evidence in case of logical deductions and induction?


## 2. How to get to the truth
We can experience reality through our senses. We can see the sun and the trees, we can feel the wind and the heat, we can hear when leaves fall to the ground, we can smell the flowers and so on. But is experiencing and observing enough? 

If I see a fruit falling to the ground from a tree. When can we say that the belief "I saw a fruit falling to the ground" is true? It's not impossible that what I thought as a fruit was actually some other object like an animal. It's also possible that it was just a spek of dust on peripheral of my eye which I thought was a fruit falling. Such mistakes happens to the best of us. In such examples it is more of our error at play than anything else. We should know how to not let such errors influence our beliefs. 

More than forming belief about what we observed, generalizing to unobserved is what makes beliefs useful. We can observe that wind blew and fruit fell and believe that it happened. It will be an useful belief because we can then go over the area where fruit fell and eat it. However, it will be more useful to have a belief which we can use to predict when fruits fall or why fruits fall. We can use such beliefs to either make the fruits fall or be under the right tree when a fruit falls before anyone else.

Notes:
1. Epistemic rationality is about building accurate maps of the world; forming true beliefs.

## 3. But why to have true beliefs?

We want to have true believes because they are useful for us. If one falsely believes that they can fly, you'd find them dead soon in an attempt to fly away from a cliff. 

Questions to ask:
1. How does "fake it till you make it" makes sense in this context? Is positive thinking shown to cause desired effects?
